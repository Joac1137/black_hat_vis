Dataset: The dataset for this exercise consists of the yearly average temperatures in the four cities of Dallas, Denver, Oklahoma City, and Seattle from 1850 through 2013. We will be working with the 10 year moving average to somewhat reduce the noise in the data. You can find the data here (ZIP) and a quick overview of the data as produced by the MS Excel charting wizard can be found here (PDF). I have left the "city" column in the data in case you want to join the four datasets into one - e.g., for putting them in one chart.

Process: You will have some time to work on your Black Hat Visualization on Monday (26-SEP-2022) in the 3rd lecture hour together with your teammates. At the latest on Tuesday evening (27-SEP-2022 at 8pm) please upload your visualization to your group's discussion board. I will then fetch it from there. You will be able to present your visualization to everyone on Wednesday morning during the TA session (28-SEP-2022 at 8.15am) and everyone will have some time to guess at the tricks and lies you managed to include in your visualization. After everyone has presented, we'll determine the winners.

Categories: We will pick the winners in four different categories:

The most mistaken: the group that managed to squeeze the most design mistakes into one visualization
The most sneaky: the group whose visualization contained the most undetected mistakes
The most ugly: the group that made the ugliest visualization (by popular vote)
The most dishonest: the group whose visualization best conveyed the exact opposite of what's in the data
Rules: The only rule is that you cannot falsify the data, but you can certainly aggregate, accumulate, average, or otherwise post-process the data so that it fits a particular chart type - e.g., aggregate into decades to show as column chart. Also, you are free to subset the data - i.e., show all or only part of it.

Practical considerations: 

You can use whichever tool you want to create the visualization, also submit hand-drawn images, or combine both (e.g., an Excel chart that you printed and manipulated with scissors, glue, and colored pens to your liking before taking its picture).
The recommended tool chain is to use a charting tool that provides SVG export (e.g., LibreOffice Calc or Vega-Lite) to create a base visualization and then use a vector drawing program (e.g., Inkscape) to make additional adjustments.
It is usually a very good idea to focus on one of the four categories listed above. If you want to go for multiple categories, please consider submitting multiple visualizations - e.g., an ugly and a dishonest one.
If you are looking for possible mistakes, errors, and biases to include, you are again very much pointed to Wikipedia. If you want to win the award for the sneakiest visualization, it is certainly a good idea to also look elsewhere as everyone will most certainly be checking for those issues mentioned on that Wikipedia page...
Since the projection surfaces in Finladsgade 6 are rather small, it may make sense for you to bring a device with which you can join the Zoom room, so that you have a high-res copy of the visualizations in front of you to admire them properly and to find the smaller issues.
If there are any questions or if I have forgotten anything, please let me know!

Note that there are good reasons why you would normally not show absolute average surface temperatures, but instead show temperature anomalies (deviations from the normal temperature for a given location and time of year): https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/faq/abs_temp.html
